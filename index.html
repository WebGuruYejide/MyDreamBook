                  I am Yejide, a Servant mother. I assist young women to graduate from college and gain self-sufficiency, using the power of God. I am good at what I do. Welcome to my space in the cyber world. I am in the process of learning computer coding languages and emerging technology to create the life of service I dream of living. A lifestyle of community service. </p>
                <p>I intend to use cyberspace to create the virtual version of the life I AM going to live. I am seeking the attention and support of a particular group of people on the planet: Googlers. I intend to create, in cyberspace, an environment that inspires the geeks who are Googlers to share their network with me to help meet my goal: To use Google products to inspire one million people to donate $50 to see my dream IRL. And so, this site starts here on July 16, 2021, with an HTML file and will evolve, as I learn what I need to learn to code and create the space I see in my mind. </p>
                    <p>
                        Why Googlers, specifically? Aside from the fact that they generally are some cool-azz people using technology to do some cool-azz stuff in the world . . . The very first time I spoke my goal in public, I was standing in a Grow with Google event, at the Mellwood Art and Entertainment Center in Louisville, Ky back in March of 2018. https://grow.google/events/louisville/  Interesting fact: I just watched that video and saw MYSELF, in the background, just over the shoulder of the mayor of the city, as he was being interviewed! I assume the video has been up since at least April of 2018, it is my first time seeing it. One more way for the Universe to confirm I am on the right path.</h5></p>
                
                <p>
                    At the event, through a set of unusual incidents, I found myself in front of a camera, speaking my goal. "To use Google products to inspire 1 million people to donate $5 to see my dream come true." When filming was done, the cameraman Michael, (I regret that I did not get his last name, I was so shocked at his response) handed me twenty dollars. I still have that $20.00 bill and when the campaign that comes from this creation process launches, it WILL start with the #2 because his donation will be recorded first. His reaction and response confirmed for me that I could be successful at achieving my goal. It has taken me this long to heal and gain the strength to believe in myself and my talents as much as I do in those I serve in my community. </p>
                <p>
                    My first step is to replace the landing page on the Google sites platform, where my domain has been sitting since 2006 and the launch of Google Apps for your Domain and then move it to the Google Cloud Platform. Google's free suite of services has allowed me to maintain contact with young people in extreme situations. For example, being able to give a daughter a phone number that she could use, free of any charge, strengthened my service offerings in untold ways. A major symptom of poverty is the inability to maintain connections to key sources and resources. </p>
                <p> People with a regular income can choose to pay their bills on time. Poverty means not having consistent phone service. A Google Voice number provides a consistent point of contact. There are children of mine, without a Google Voice number, who have changed their phone number 15 times in two years. ONLY ya momma is going to care enough to keep up with THAT many changes. Because of Google, anyone who knows my name can connect with me; anyone who had my number before I became homeless, can still reach me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I admire, respect, and appreciate Google, as a company. As they grew, they did not drop and forget about the little folks at the bottom. While Google Apps, as I used it, stopped being offered for free back in 2011, they grandfathered me in and kept providing me access to new products and services. THAT is good business. My Google Voice phone number has allowed me to maintain a consistent, peaceful presence in the lives of children I would have otherwise lost contact with, years ago. My ability to give a young person an @Yejide email address has allowed for opportunities not normally possible for the community I serve. Google, the company, through their amazing services had been essential in my handling financial hardship and still being of service in my community.

                       Through a powerful Code Louisville connection, I was blessed with an amazing opportunity. I have recently been accepted into Google's Black+ Developer Training Cloud Cohort. This IS a life-changing opportunity for me. They are providing me with a teacher, a tutor, a mentor, a computer, and a stipend to help me exceed the level of success I have set for myself. Watch me grow, with Google!!!

                    To those who may be curious because I talk about God, A LOT. When I do, I am referring to the Divine Sentient Energy Who created the concept and color green. Whenever you see, hear, taste, touch and take the time to appreciate the many variations, hues, textures, tastes, and manifestations of the color green, you are experiencing the God of My Understanding . . . My Boss, Who is God. I teach my grandgoodies: When you feel the wind on your skin it is My God saying, "I am here." I serve this Energy because It inspires me to be peaceful, loving, kind, and generous towards other humans. With my mind, that is in the best interest of all who must deal with me. I am 1/2 holy - 1/2 hood - cool to pray with - a mistake to play with.

    <dt>I am Yeh-Jee-Day, I answer to JiJi. My pronouns are she/her. I am a peaceful passenger on a protected journey home, to serve. Unless you harm one of my daughters, I am then - a maternal energy to be feared. I WILL prove that it is unwise and unhealthy to do my daughters harm.
